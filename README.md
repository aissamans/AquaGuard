# AquaGuard
AquaGuard is an intelligent leak detection system for LYDECâ€™s 4,500 km water network in Casablanca, developed as my Engineering Graduation Project. It employs R-based algorithms for data correction, forecasting, data mining, and ML-driven anomaly detection to optimize performance and reduce losses.
